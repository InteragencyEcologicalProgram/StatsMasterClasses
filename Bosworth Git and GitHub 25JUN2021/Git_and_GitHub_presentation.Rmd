## Goal of Workshop

- Provide a basic overview of Git and GitHub
- Information on how to use these tools with data science projects
- Focus is from a beginner perspective
- Interactive - please feel free to ask questions or provide feedback during the workshop

## Overview of Workshop

- What is Git and GitHub and why should I use them?
- Common Terminology
- Configuring Git
- Getting Started using Git and GitHub
  - Creating and Cloning Repositories
  - Committing, Pushing, and Pulling
- Collaborating with Others
  - Forking vs. Cloning
  - Adding Collaborators
  - Avoiding Merge Conflicts
- General Workflows

## Git vs. GitHub {.build}

**Git** is a version control system originally used by software developers to work together on large projects

**GitHub** is a web or cloud-hosting service for Git-based projects

## Why should I use it?

-	Version control and backup
-	**Collaboration**
-	Sharing and developing R packages

## Common Terms

> - Repository: a set of files managed by Git
> - Commit: a "snapshot" of all of the files in the repository at a particular time
> - Local repository: A project saved on your computer
> - Remote repository: Version of the project that is hosted somewhere other than your computer. Most common is GitHub.
> - Push: Sends changes made on a local repository to the remote repository
> - Fetch: Retrieves changes from a remote repository, but does **NOT** change the state of the local repository in any way
> - Pull: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the local repository
> - Branch: Parallel tracks that allow multiple users to work on the same project without overwriting work
> - Organization: shared accounts where businesses and open-source projects can collaborate across many projects at once

## Local vs. Remote repositories {.centered}

# Git and GitHub Setup | Any issues with installation or setting up accounts?

## Configuring Git with your name and email

Using Git Bash or command line:

`git config --global user.name 'Your Name'`\
`git config --global user.email 'yourname@domain.com'`\
Check configuration with `git config --global --list`
<br>
<br>

Using the [`usethis package`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) in R:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_git_config(user.name = "Your Name", user.email = "yourname@domain.com")
```

# Getting Started

## Creating and Cloning Repositories

Purpose: Check configuration on our computers, and introduce basic concepts of Git and GitHub

> 1) Create a new repository on GitHub
> 2) Clone the new repository to your local computer using RStudio
>    - *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*
>    - Copy the URL of your new GitHub repository and paste it into “repository URL”
> 3) Check if you have a local repository stored on your computer

## Commit and Push from Local Repository

> 1) Make a change to the README file in your local repository
> 2) Stage and commit this change using the Git pane in RStudio
> 3) Push your commit to your remote repository on GitHub
>     - If you are a new GitHub user, you will be asked to provide your username and password
> 4) Check if your local change is now on your GitHub remote
> 5) Repeat the steps above to check if your GitHub credentials were cached properly (You should **NOT** be asked for your username and password a second time)

## Commit in GitHub and Pull into Local Repository

> 1) Make a change to the README file in your remote repository on GitHub
> 2) Commit this change in GitHub
> 3) Pull change into your local repository using the Git pane in RStudio
> 4) Confirm that the change is now in your local repository

# Collaborating with Others

## Cloning vs. Forking Repositories {.build}

Clone:

  * A copy of a remote repository stored as a local repository on your computer
  * Able to push, fetch, and pull changes directly with the remote repository
  * Usually the configuration with your own repositories or with other repositories that you are a collaborator on
  
Fork:

  * A special configuration which is usually a copy of someone else's repository
  * Able to fetch and pull changes and make edits on your forked copy
  * **NOT** able to directly push edits to the original repository, only to the forked repository
  * Usually the configuration when you create pull requests or when you are not a collaborator on a public repository

## Adding Collaborators

Allows for others to clone your repository and directly push, fetch, and pull changes

> 1) Open up "Settings" in your remote repository on GitHub
> 2) Select "Manage access" and then "Invite a collaborator"
> 3) Enter the username of your collaborator
> 4) A confirmation email will be sent to your collaborator. Wait for them to confirm.

## Avoiding Merge Conflicts

A merge conflict occurs when 2 people change the same lines in the same file without first pulling in the changes that the other has made. This is always a possibility when 2 or more people are actively working on a repository.
<br>
<br>

How to avoid:

* Communicate often with your collaborators
* Pull each time you open up the project in RStudio
* Use the workflow: *Pull > Edit > Pull > Commit > Push*
* Pull before every commit, and commit often

# General Workflows

## Creating Repositories

1) Create a new repository on GitHub
2) Clone the new repository to your local computer using one of the following methods:
    - RStudio: *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*
    - Git Bash or command line: `git clone <repo URL>`
    - Using the [`usethis package`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) in R:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
usethis::create_from_github("repo URL")
```
<br>

**TIP:** Use a consistent directory on your computer for your local Git repositories 

## Committing Changes

1) Make some changes to the repository
2) Stage the changes using one of the following methods:
    - RStudio: check the box next to the file(s) you would like to commit in the Git pane
    - Git Bash or command line: `git add <directory or file>`
3) Commit staged changes using one of the following methods:
    - RStudio: use the commit window accessed from the Git pane
    - Git Bash or command line: `git commit -m "<message>"`
<br>
<br>

**TIP:** Make each commit for one specific change to the repository

## Pushing and Pulling

Push:

- RStudio: use the button in the Git pane
- Git Bash or command line: `git push <remote> <branch>`

Push one or more commits to the remote repository once you have a finished product or fix
<br>
<br>

Pull: 

- RStudio: use the button in the Git pane
- Git Bash or command line: `git pull <remote>`

For shared repositories, it is good practice to pull in the most recent changes in the remote repository at the beginning of your session and before you commit.
